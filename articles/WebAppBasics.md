## How to create a web application on PythonAnywhere


Your PythonAnywhere account comes with a website at
`http://your-username.pythonanywhere.com/`. Paying users can also set their
accounts up [to have websites with custom domains](/pages/CustomDomains).

You can create an app to run there by going to the
[Web](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/web_app_setup/) tab of your dashboard. From
there you click on the "Add a new web app" button, which will pop up a wizard
where you can chose the domain to use (if your account allows custom domains)
and then select a web application framework. We have "quickstart" options for
Django, web2py, Bottle and Flask, and there is also a "Manual configuration"
option where you can generate a standard template WSGI file that can be modified
to support many other web frameworks (though it does require a little more
expertise than using the quickstart options).
