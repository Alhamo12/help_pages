##Types of PythonAnywhere consoles


In the [Consoles page](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/consoles/) you'll find links to start various types of console:

  * Python 2 or 3, using either the standard Python shell or IPython. If you've never tried IPython, check it out, it's pretty cool!
  * Bash
  * [PyPy](//pypy.org/)
  * MySQL
