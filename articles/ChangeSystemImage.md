# Changing Your System Image

If you would like to upgrade your system image for your PythonAnywhere account,
you will need to contact an administrator by pressing "Send feedback" on the dashboard.

## Potential Breakage

If you do get your image updated, what may happen is your code breaking.
You will also need to regenerate any virtual environments you have created.
