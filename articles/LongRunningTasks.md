PythonAnywhere consoles can run for a long time, but we do occasionally have to
bounce our servers for maintenance. So, while you can usually keep a console
program running for a long time, you will occasionally find it resets itself.

If you want to keep a process running more or less permanently, or have it
restart automatically, and you have a **paid** account, the best solution is to use
what we call an "Always-on task".  This is officially speaking a beta feature,
but we're happy to switch it on for anyone with a paid account -- drop us a line
at [support@pythonanywhere.com](mailto:support@pythonanywhere.com).
